## How to run a js file and view the output?

### 1. Create an html file and add the following code to it
```html
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>

<script src="wherever_your_js_file_is_located_relative_to_the_html_file"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
The results will be displayed in the browser console(press Ctrl + Shift + I or F12 to open console).

### 2. Run it via node(preferred). 
To do that make sure that you have node installed on your machine. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v . This should print a version number, so you'll see something like this v0.10.35 .

If its not installed, download the latest stable version from https://nodejs.org/en/.
Open cmd or terminal and run yourfile.js with node.

Run the javascript file by typing:

node yourfile.js
